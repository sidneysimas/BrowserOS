 * megabyte image dataUrl would explode URL length limits and round-
 * trip badly. This module is the rich-data side channel for the same
 * navigation: the composer writes here, the chat screen reads here on
 * mount.
 *
 * Intentionally module-scope. Same render tree, same tab — no need
 * for sessionStorage (which would force JSON-serialising the dataUrls
 * and re-parsing on the read side). Cross-tab handoff is out of
 * scope: the user typing at home in tab A and switching to tab B's
 * chat would surface an empty registry there, which is the correct
 * behaviour.
