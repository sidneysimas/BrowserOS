/**
 * Planner types. Pure discriminated unions, no I/O anywhere.
 *
 * State is what the planner sees at the boundary: the workspace
 * manifest plus every agent config file the caller opted in to
 * reading. Plan is the exact list of filesystem ops that would run,
 * with a next-manifest snapshot the caller can inspect before applying.
 *
 * The whole point of these types is that a planner call cannot lie
 * about what it would do. If planDisconnect touches an agent that
 * was not in the input, that agent shows up in `ops`. If planRemove
 * drops a shared manifest entry, the caller sees `nextManifest` before
 * anything is written. The class-based v0.0.3 API could not offer
 * this because state mutated across method calls.
